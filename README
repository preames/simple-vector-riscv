This repo contains a small corpus of simple vectorizable loops and the corresponding LLVM IR and assembly.  These are compiled with an arbitrary (and changing) local snapshot of ToT clang for a somewhat representative riscv64 configuration.

The primary point of this is to help me in my LLVM development efforts (i.e. I analyze the assembly looking for oppurtunities), and to be able to link to things easily in public discussion.

Everything in this repo can be considered to be in the public domain.
